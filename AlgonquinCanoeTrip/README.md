# Algonquin Canoe Trip Map Assets
The assets contained within this folder make up much of the various illustrations that I created to populate this [map](https://warrenrdavison.wixsite.com/maps/algonquin2021).

I illustrated these assets using the pixel persona in Affinity Designer and then used the [Trace Bitmap](https://inkscape.org/doc/tutorials/tracing/tutorial-tracing.html) tool in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) before importing the back into [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) as `.svg` files. This allowed me to stretch, skew, re-colour without having to deal with pixels.

It also meant I could easily export them and share for others to use!

See the asset sheet to preview symbols and their file names.
