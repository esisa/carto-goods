20180309 - initial upload.
20180803 - Updated the kerning on the capital 'Y' character.
20180807 - Additional kerning updates to a number of characters.

I'm not a typographer but I made this font as a little side project because I needed something for a map I was making (also as a side project).

I've only made the characters I needed at the time and am still working on fixing some characters (some appear as nulls???).

Also I hacked it a little bit and used the '+' character as a means for a floating 'c' so I could do things like McDonald.

I'll update as necessary.
